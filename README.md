### About the Site

This is a static website build on HTML + CSS + JS. This website does not have any backend code like PHP/NodeJS etc.
The planet system at the page's top is made using the [P5 JS](https://p5js.org/) library for ease in drawing.

On top of CSS, an additional styling library called [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used which makes front end styling
significantly easy. The site is 'responsive', meaning that the same code works on both mobile and desktop.

The scrolling fade-in effect is achieved using the [ScrollReveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/) library. Other than that, even 
[JQuery](https://code.jquery.com/) library can be used, which is significantly easier than using plain JavaScript.
